We then remove a CDR3 at random from one of these samples (and to be fair, we remove the same CDR3 from all the other samples if it occurs).  We then look at the distance between this CDR3 and the remaining CDR3s in the samples, and we see which sample is closest.  We **guess** that this is the sample that the CDR3 was originally removed from.  Finally, we rerun the whole process `num_trials` times and report the percentage of guesses that were correct (the **accuracy**)."
